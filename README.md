## Overview

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine represent two distinct approaches to health and healing. TCM emphasizes holistic balance, Qi, Yin-Yang, and natural remedies, while Western Medicine focuses on evidence-based diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, and surgical interventions. This repository bridges the gap by providing comparative notes, case studies, and resources for learners interested in integrative medicine.

Key topics include:
- Fundamental concepts in TCM (e.g., meridians, acupuncture, herbal medicine)
- Core principles of Western Medicine (e.g., anatomy, pharmacology, pathology)
- Comparative analyses (e.g., treatment of common diseases like diabetes or hypertension from both perspectives)
- Emerging research on integrative approaches

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for easy navigation:

- **/tcm-basics/**: Notes on TCM fundamentals, including theory, diagnostics, and therapies.
- **/western-medicine/**: Overviews of Western medical systems, diseases, and treatments.
- **/integrative-studies/**: Comparisons, case studies, and research on combining TCM and Western methods.
- **/resources/**: Links to books, articles, websites, and tools for further reading.
- **/images/**: Diagrams, charts, and visuals to illustrate concepts.

Each note is written in Markdown format for readability. Files are named descriptively, e.g., `tcm-yin-yang-theory.md`.
